HTML: Creates a simple layout with a textarea for posts, a button to submit, and a container to display posts.

CSS: Styles the page, including the container, textarea, buttons, and posts for a clean look.

JavaScript: Adds interactivity.

When the "Post" button is clicked, the text from the textarea is retrieved.

If the text is not empty, a new post is created dynamically.

Each post contains the user's message, a "Like" button, and a likes counter.

The post is added to the top of the posts container.

The "Like" button allows users to like a post.

Clicking the "Like" button increments the likes counter for that post.

The likes counter updates in real-time.

Posts are styled with padding, borders, and background colors.

Buttons have hover effects for better user interaction.

The page is centered and has a maximum width for better readability.

No backend is used, so posts and likes are not saved permanently.

This is a front-end-only implementation.

To make it functional, a backend (e.g., Node.js) and database (e.g., MySQL) are needed.

User authentication would also be required for a real social media platform.

The code demonstrates basic DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

Itâ€™s a simple example for learning purposes.
